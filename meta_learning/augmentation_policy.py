## we are using bayesian probabilities to find the best augmentation policy
'''
Bayesian optimization works by building a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameters to the validation score and then choosing hyperparameters to try based on this model. It's more efficient than grid search, especially when the number of hyperparameters is large.

This process can indeed be considered a form of meta-learning because it is essentially learning the best way to augment the data for improved performance on a given task.
